# Creating virtual server instances (CLI)
{: #creating-virtual-servers-cli}

You can create {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} instances by using the command line interface (CLI).
{:shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #prereq-creating-virtual-servers-cli}

1. Ensure that you downloaded, installed, and initialized the following CLI plug-ins:
    * {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
    * The vpc-infrastructure plug-in

   For more information, see [IBM Cloud CLI for VPC Reference](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-vpc-reference).
   
   When you install the vpc-infrastructure plug-in for the first time, you must set the target generation to gen 1, `ibmcloud is target --gen 1`.
   {:important}
   
   
2. Make sure that you already [created an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-started).

## Gathering information to create an instance by using the CLI
{: #gathering-information-to-create-an-instance-using-the-cli}

Ready to create an instance? Before you can run the `ibmcloud is instances` command, you need to know the details about the instance, such as what profile or image you want to use.

Let's gather that information first:

|    Instance details   |  Listing options                |  Copy your values                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------|---------------------------------------------- |
| Image                 | `ibmcloud is images`            |                           |
| Profile               | `ibmcloud is instance-profiles` |                           |
| Key                   | `ibmcloud is keys`              |                           |
| VPC                   | `ibmcloud is vpcs`              |                           |
| Subnet                | `ibmcloud is subnets`           |                           |
| Zone                  | `ibmcloud is zones`             |                           |   
{: caption="Table 1. Required instance details" caption-side="top"}   

Use the following commands to determine the required information for creating a new instance.

1. List the regions associated with your account.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is regions
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:
   ```
   Name       Endpoint               Status   
   us-south   /v1/regions/us-south   available
   ```
   {:screen}

2. List the zones associated with the specified region.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is zones us-south
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:
   ```
   Name         Region     Status   
   us-south-2   us-south   available
   ```
   {:screen}

3. List the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}s that are associated with your account.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is vpcs
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:
   ```
   ID                                     Name                                  Default   Created       Status      Tags   
   xxx1xx23-4xx5-6789-12x3-456xx7xx123x   my-vpc                                yes       1 month ago   available   -

   ```
   {:screen}

   If you do not have an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} available, you can create one by using the `ibmcloud is vpc-create` command. For more information about creating an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, see [IBM Cloud VPC CLI Reference](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-vpc-reference#vpc-create).

4. List the subnets that are associated with the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is subnets
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:
   ```
   ID                                     Name                                     IPv*   Subnet CIDR         Addresses   Gen   ACL   Gateway   Created       Status      VPC                        Zone         Resource Group   Tags

   ```
   {:screen}

   If you do not have a subnet available, you can create one by using the `ibmcloud is subnet-create` command. For more information about creating a subnet, see [IBM Cloud VPC CLI Reference](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-vpc-reference#subnets).

5. List the available profiles for creating your instance.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is instance-profiles
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:

   {:screen}

6. List the available images for creating your instance.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is images   
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:
   ```
   ID                                     Name                 OS                                                       Arch    Created       Status   Visibility   Tags

   ```
   {:screen}

7. List the available SSH keys that you can associate with your instance.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is keys
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For this example, you'd see a response similar to the following output:
   ```
   ID                                     Name           Type   Length   FingerPrint          Created        Resource Group   Tags

   ```
   {:screen}

   If you do not have an SSH key available, you can create one by using the `ibmcloud is key-create` command. You can add SSH keys to your instance only when you initially create the instance. For more information about managing SSH keys, see [Managing SSH keys](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys).

## Creating an instance using the CLI
{: #creating-an-instance-using-the-cli}

After you know these values, use them to run the `instance-create` command. You must also specify a name for the instance. The following example shows the command in action (using generic x and 123 values, for example purposes only).  

When you provision an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically created as a primary boot volume and attached to the instance. The following example shows how to include a secondary volume with the `--volume-attach` parameter. Including a secondary volume is optional.
{:note}

1. Create a new instance.
   ```
   $ ibmcloud is instance-create \
       <INSTANCE_NAME> \
       <VPC_ID> \
       <ZONE_NAME> \
       <PROFILE_ID> \
       <SUBNET_ID> \
       --image <IMAGE_ID> \
       --keys <KEY_IDS>
       --volume-attach <VOLUME_ATTACH_JSON or JSON file>
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   For example, if you are creating an instance that is called _my-instance_ in _us-south-2_ and using the _bc1-2x4_ profile, your `instance-create` command would look similar to the following sample:

   ```
   $ ibmcloud is instance-create \
       my-instance \
       xxx1xx23-4xx5-6789-12x3-456xx7xx123x \
       us-south-2 \
       bc1-2x4 \
       1234x12x-345x-1x23-45x6-x7x891011x1x \
       --image 1xx2x34x-5678-12x3-x4xx-567x81234567 \
       --keys 1234xxxx-x12x-xxxx-34xx-xx1234xxxxxx
       --volume-attach @/Users/myname/myvolume-attachment_create.json
   ```
   {:codeblock}

   Where:
   - `INSTANCE_NAME` is _my-instance_
   - `VPC_ID` is _VPC_ID_
   - `ZONE_NAME` is  _us-south-2_
   - `PROFILE_ID` is _bc1-2x4_
   - `SUBNET_ID` is _SUBNET_ID_
   - `IMAGE_ID` is _IMAGE_ID_
   - `KEY_IDS` is _KEY_ID1, KEY_ID2, ..._
   - `VOLUME_ATTACH_JSON` is the volume attachment specification in JSON format, provided in the command or as a file. For an example of a volume attachment JSON for a data volume, see [Example secondary volume JSON file](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-storage#secondary-volume-byok-json).

   For this example, you'd see the following responses. 
   
   The following response varies depending on what optional values you use.

## Next steps
{: #next-cli-connecting-to-instance}

<!-- A series of emails are sent to your administrator: acknowledgment of the virtual server instance order, order approval and processing, and a message stating the instance is created. -->

After the server is created, you can connect to your instance. For more information, see [Connecting to your Linux instance](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-connecting-to-your-linux-instance#connecting-to-your-linux-instance) or [Connecting to your Windows instance](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-connecting-to-your-windows-instance#connecting-to-your-windows-instance).
