# Getting started with Virtual Servers for VPC
{: #getting-started}

Use {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} (VPC) on Classic infrastructure to provision scalable compute resources in the IBM Cloud.
{:shortdesc}

You can create as many virtual servers as you need, configure network and security, and manage storage. All of this is available in an improved IBM Cloud console. The console is built to provide you with quick and easy access to adjust your environment with your changing workload demands. Bet you're anxious to get started, so let's get straight to business.

Before you begin, make sure you have [created an IBM Cloud VPC](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-started).
{:important}

{{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}} are not compatible with the classic virtual server offerings. If you are interested in any of the classic virtual server offerings, see [IBM Cloud Virtual Servers](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-getting-started-tutorial).
